## Introduction

*ALWAYS MAKE A BACKUP OF ANY IMPORTANT DATA BEFORE STARTING*
I performed this on a clean install of Ubuntu 24.04 however this should work on both 24.04 and 22.04 and shouldn't require a fresh install. However, I would recommend if issues arise to use a clean install since this is what worked for me and prevents any data loss
It is possible that this won't work for everyone however this should work with any gfx1100 gpu or gfx1030 gpu. Bear in mind I have only tested this on 7900xtx so your mileage may vary

## Setting up the BIOS

To enter your BIOS search you board manufacturer's BIOS key and press that on
